# Make-Files-Visible-in-USB
I have created an application to make your files which are hidden because of some kind of the viruses , visible. It's so simple to use it. Just select the USB device which has a problem and press START.  PS: It works only on Windows OS.Also you have to install java (https://www.java.com/en/)
